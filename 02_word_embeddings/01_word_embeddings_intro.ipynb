    "# What Are Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings** are a way to represent text (**words, sentences, or documents**) as **numbers** so that computers can understand **meaning**, not just exact words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Simple Terms\n",
    "- Embeddings convert text into **vectors** (lists of numbers).\n",
    "- These vectors **capture the meaning** of the text.\n"

    "## Why Embeddings Are Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers **cannot understand human language directly**.\n",
    "- They can only process **numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Older Methods\n",
    "- Traditional techniques like **TF-IDF** only **count word frequency**.\n",
    "- They **do not understand meaning or context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Embeddings Help\n",
    "- **Embeddings** represent the **semantic meaning** of text.\n",
    "- This allows machines to understand **similarity and context**, not just exact words."
